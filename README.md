# renpy-web-icon-converter
A simple python software to convert your png image into an icon set for your Ren'Py web application

Hello!

I am a novice game developer at Ren'Py. Wanting to download my game as a web application, I was faced with the necessity to replace a set of standard Ren'Py icons with my custom ones, and decided to create a simple program for quick convertion of the desired image to all the necessary resolutions.

I just started learning Python, so I asked the neural network for help and it helped me create the necessary application. 

I decided to share it with others.

### Installation

1. First, you should download convert_icons_gui.py file.
2. Then you need to install Python on your computer.
3. You will also need to install Pillow library for Python. Open your PowerShell after the Python installation and write:

> pip install pillow

or

>pip3 install pillow

for python3
4. After this you'll be able to start convert_icons_gui.py and convert your png image into required files for your web Ren'Py game.
